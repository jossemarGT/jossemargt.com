Bare [JossemarGT's website](http://jossemargt.com) content.

## FAQ

- *How do you transform these bunch of markdown files into a website?* There's
nothing new about static site generators like jekyll, octopress or hugo, I use
the last one as markdown "preprocessor" which spits out a static web site.

- *Where can I read more about the tool that you use for this website?* You can
find all the needed documentation at [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/).

- *Why the public (and others) directory is empty?* Because, one _should_ not
  commit binaries into git history and I push my self to generate everysingle
  asset from either code or straight markdown files.

- *What's the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and
everything?* 42

**NOTE:** I'm writing this file in English just for mere habit (on matters of
README files on public repositories) but have in mind that most of the content
on this repository/website will be in Spanish.
