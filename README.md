Bare [JossemarGT's website](http://jossemargt.com) content.

## FAQ

- *How do you transform these bunch of markdown files into a website?* There's
nothing new about static site generators like jekyll, octopress or hugo, I use
the last one as markdown "preprocessor" which spits out a static web site.

- *Where can I read more about the tool that you use for this website?* You can
find all the needed documentation at [Hugo website](https://gohugo.io/).

- *I know that hugo generates all the needed assets for a complete static
website in the public directory, but, can you tell me why is yours empty?* 1)
**Never**  commit artifacts/assets in the git history, just the sources 2) I
don't need them here, those assets  are generated in the deployment process
(which is not that elegant but it works), hopefully I'll write a post about it
later.

- *What's the Answer to the Ultimate Question Of Life, The Universe, and
Everything?* 42

**NOTE:** I'm writing this file in English just for mere habit (on matters of
README files on public repositories) but have in mind that most of the content
on this repository/website will be in Spanish.
