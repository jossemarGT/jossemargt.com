I am a [maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture) who truly enjoys
learning, teaching, creating, and experimenting. I believe that as a human, on
the right environment, we utterly must look for growing alongside those around
us.

I natively speak Spanish and proficiently in English, just like I do in
JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Bash, Java, Terraform, Groovy, Ruby, Python, and
others. But for that, I have my [resume over here](https://jossemargt.github.io/resume/),
please check it out if you are looking for my professional background.

I am one of those that adventured themselves on Entrepreneurship lands back in
2014, but after many mistakes and running out of money, I went back to the
Engineering market. I have to admit, it was a hard pill to swallow at the
beginning, but later I discovered that I was blessed to find a venue to continue
growing as a professional. With many experiences as individual contributor and
tech lead under my belt, I am now looking forward to the future.

I have many stories, ideas, and even how-to's to share, but I will use this blog
for that.

Happy hacking!
